## Welcome to my GitHub Pages

There's not much going on here at the moment, it's a work in progress.

I guess I'll be using this space as my online portfolio. A place to put any temporary projects I'm working on, a place to link to projects or documents that I may use if needing to show others my work, etc.

### Me?

Well, there's not really much I can say about myself. 
I'm a huge geek, love all things computer and techy related. Currently working as 1st line help and support for a telecommunications company, studying part time through the [Open University](http://www.open.ac.uk/) for my degree in Computing & IT. Still not sure whether to go Computer Science, Software Engineering or Software & Communications yet, but I still have time to decide.

In my spare time I'm also trying to learn Game Development with Unity and C# as well as some network penetration testing. I intend to do some more courses with the Unreal Engine too. I've also loved the coding side of things ever since a friend first introduced me to the world of Pascal in DOS. Have been hooked ever since and I have some limited experience with Pascal, Delphi, C++ and Visual Basic

### Current Projects (Works in progress)

- [Laser Defender](https://duanemetcalf.github.io/LaserDefender/) - A basic space shoot-em-up game. Is very limited but have a few ideas to expand on it when I get more time.
